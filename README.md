# Things to change when adding new posts

1. Title of the page, default is "Artwork Template"
2. Add any art in the class artwork > carousel-container > carousel formatted as...
```
<img src="lp1.png" alt="Artwork 1">
```
... where lp1.png is the name of the png in the same directory as the html file you're modifying and "Artwork 1" is what you want the alt text to be
3. Under class="Description"
    - Replace "Artwork Title" with the title of the artwork
    - Replace the standard description with something meaningful/related
